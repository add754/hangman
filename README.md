Project details
------
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The aim of this project is to demonstrate basic Python development skills.

This has helped refresh my knowledge of basic Python syntax and coding standards.

Installation instructions
------
Ensure Python 3.11.4 or later is installed.

Usage instructions
------
This game can be run from the command line. To run as an executable, simply doouble click on the file after following the installation instructions above. To run, clone the repository locally and navigate to the 'hangman' folder in your chosen terminal. Run `python milestone_5.py` to play the game. This file contains the completed version of the hangman game.
