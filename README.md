Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The aim of this project is to demonstrate basic Python development skills.

This has helped refresh my knowledge of basic Python syntax and coding standards.
